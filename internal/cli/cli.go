// Package cli runs cairn's commands. It never prompts and never opens an editor.
//
// Arguments: flags start with "--" and take "--name value" or "--name=value"; --json, --retracted, --branches,
// --own-branch, --closed, --archived, --owed and --all take no value. Flags and positional arguments can come in any
// order, and "--" ends the flags. A flag that takes a value takes the next argument even when it starts with "-", so
// "--tag -t" works, but not one that starts with "--": that is a missing value, and "--name=--value" passes such a
// value. --tag can be repeated; for any other flag the last one wins. No arguments at all is a usage error. help with
// any arguments, and "--help" or "-h" anywhere before "--" (even as a flag's value, and after any command), run help.
// "--version" means version. search --meaning, which a later step builds, is a usage error until then. So are
// --retracted anywhere but show, --branches anywhere but ls and show, --own-branch anywhere but init, --closed
// and --owed anywhere but ls, --archived, --limit and --all anywhere but ls and search, and --html, which takes a
// value, anywhere but board.
//
// Tracker: "-C <dir>" as the first two arguments runs the command as if Env.Dir were dir, after Env.Dir when it is
// relative, with its links resolved before any ".." in it; a dir that is missing or not a folder is an "error", and a
// missing dir, or one that starts with "--", is a usage error. Help still wins, as above. A "-C" anywhere else before
// "--", a flag's value included, is a usage error. Every command but init, help and version uses the
// tracker that store.Find reaches from Env.Dir, else, without -C, the global tracker: store.Global of the user config
// file, store.UserConfigFile in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME when it is an absolute path, else in $HOME/.config. When neither
// names an absolute path, there is no global tracker.
//
// Output: --json anywhere before "--" turns on JSON, even when the other arguments are wrong. With --json, success
// prints {"ok": true, "data": …} and failure prints
// {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "…", "message": "…"}} on stdout, plus the message on one line of stderr. Without
// --json, success prints text on stdout and failure prints "cairn: <message>" on one line of stderr and nothing on
// stdout. A command that succeeds with warnings still exits 0, and prints each warning in both modes as one line
// "cairn: warning: <message>" on stderr. With --json, its envelope also has "warnings": [<message>, …], in the same
// order, and without warnings it has no "warnings" key. A command that fails prints no warnings. JSON writes <, > and &
// as they are, not as \u003c, \u003e and \u0026. ls and search also have "total" in their envelope, after "data", as
// --limit below says; no other command's envelope has it.
//
// Exit codes and error codes:
//   - 0: ok.
//   - 1: "no_tracker" (no .cairn here or above, and no global tracker), "exists" (init where .cairn exists or another tracker would be
//     hidden, or milestone new for an id that has a file), "error" (anything else).
//   - 2: "usage": an unknown command or flag, a missing or extra argument, a missing value, or a value in the wrong
//     form, including a bad date, a status not in the config, a tag whose group is not in the config, and a write
//     with no actor.
//   - 4: "not_found": no issue, comment or milestone with that id, including an id that is not valid. The message names
//     the id that was not found.
//
// Writes (new, edit, rm, comment, retract, purge, milestone new, milestone edit) need an actor: --as, or else the
// CAIRN_ACTOR environment variable. They also take --persona and --model. new records them on the issue as by, persona
// and model, once: no later write changes them, and an issue without them keeps "". comment records them the same way
// on the comment, and retract records the actor as retracted_by; the other writes check the actor but store it nowhere.
//
// Commit on write: when the config's commit is true, a write that succeeds commits what it changed, as it is on disk:
// its issue's folder, issues/<id>, or for milestone new and milestone edit the milestone's file, milestones/<id>.md.
// git runs in the tracker's folder, first "git add -A -- <path>", then "git commit -m <message> -- <path>", so nothing
// else is staged or committed, and an earlier change to the same issue that was never committed goes in too. The
// message is "chore(cairn): <command> <id> (by <actor>)", where command is new, edit, rm, comment, retract, purge,
// milestone new or milestone edit, and id is the issue's or the milestone's. git's own config names the author, and
// the repository's hooks run. Each git step runs once, so two writes at the same moment can collide on git's locks.
// When git fails (no git, no repository, another writer's lock, a hook), or config.yml cannot be read after a write
// that did not need it, the write stands and the command still succeeds, with the warning
// "not committed: <the error>". But when git status then shows nothing left to commit at the path, another writer
// committed the change first, and there is no warning. A write that fails commits nothing, and init commits only as
// init --own-branch describes.
//
// Commands:
//   - init: makes .cairn in Env.Dir (it does not look upward for a place to put it). It is "exists", and changes
//     nothing, when Env.Dir already has a .cairn, or when store.Find from Env.Dir reaches a tracker on its own branch,
//     as a linked worktree reaches its main checkout's, with a message that names that tracker's folder; with or
//     without --own-branch. Without it, when Env.Dir has a .git, init runs git once, and is "exists" too when
//     origin/cairn holds a tracker (a config.yml at its top), with a message that names cairn init --own-branch.
//     Text: "initialized <the .cairn path>\n". Data: {"dir": the .cairn path, "branch": ""}.
//   - init --own-branch: keeps the tracker on the branch cairn, in a git repository of its own at .cairn. After
//     those two checks, Env.Dir must be the top folder of a main checkout, not a subfolder or a linked worktree, and an
//     origin/cairn, when there is one, must hold a tracker; anything else is an "error", and changes nothing. Then it
//     adds the line "/.cairn" to the repository's info/exclude, unless a line already says it. When origin/cairn holds
//     a tracker, it attaches it, git clone --single-branch --branch cairn <origin's URL> .cairn, and its text is
//     "attached <the .cairn path> to origin/cairn\n". Otherwise it makes it: init's files with commit: true in
//     config.yml, git init on the branch cairn, with origin's URL as the remote origin and origin/cairn as the
//     branch's upstream when the code repository has an origin, and one commit of every file, "chore(cairn): init".
//     When that commit fails, the tracker stands, uncommitted, with the warning "not committed: <the error>". Its
//     text is then "initialized <the .cairn path> on branch cairn\n". Data either way: {"dir": the .cairn path,
//     "branch": "cairn"}. It never pushes.
//   - new "title" [--body text] [--tag t]... [--milestone m] [--due YYYY-MM-DD]: adds an issue with the
//     config's first status, created and updated set to Env.Now in UTC truncated to the millisecond, and a new id.
//     The title must not be blank. A non-empty body that does not end in "\n" gets one. Repeated tags are kept once.
//     A config with no statuses is an "error". Text: the id and "\n". Data: the issue.
//   - edit <id> [--title t] [--body text] [--status s] [--tag +t] [--tag -t] [--milestone m] [--due d]: changes
//     only what is given, and at least one change is required. "+t" or "t" adds a tag (no duplicates), "-t" removes
//     it; a removed tag only has to be non-empty, so a tag whose group left the config can still go. An empty
//     --milestone or --due clears it. updated becomes Env.Now as in new. Text: the id and "\n". Data: the issue.
//   - rm <id>: deletes the issue folder, comments included. Text: "removed <id>\n". Data: {"id": id}.
//   - show <id> [--retracted]: reads any issue, closed and archived ones included. Text: the issue for a person to
//     read, with its by, persona and model when set, then its active comments in order, each with its id, kind, by,
//     persona and model when set, at, source when set, and body. --retracted adds the retracted comments in their
//     places, each marked "retracted" with its retracted_by, retracted_at, reason and disproved_by. Data: the issue
//     plus "comments", its active comments in order (all of them with --retracted), a list never null.
//   - ls [--status s] [--closed] [--archived] [--owed] [--tag t]... [--milestone m] [--due-before YYYY-MM-DD]: lists
//     issues in store order. Every filter given must match; --due-before keeps issues with a due date before d, and
//     --owed keeps issues whose latest active decision comment has no active result comment with a later at. Without
//     --status, ls leaves out closed issues unless --closed is given, and archived issues unless --archived is
//     given, as the config's closed and archived name them (model.Config.IsClosed and IsArchived); with --status s,
//     it keeps the issues whose status is s, whatever s is. Text: one "<id>\t<status>\t<title>\n" line per issue.
//     Data: a list of issues without "body" (an empty list, never null).
//   - --branches, on ls and show, adds what active branches committed, as branchIssues reads it. Without it, commit on
//     write and init, Cairn never runs git. With it, failing to read git (no git, no repository, no default branch) is
//     an "error", and a branch file that cannot be read or does not parse is a warning that names the branch and the
//     issue. On a tracker on its own branch it adds nothing and runs no git.
//   - ls --branches: the checkout's rows, then the branch versions, all through the same filters, with the
//     checkout's config. Text: a branch version's line is "<id>\t<status>\t<title>\t<branch>\n". Data: every item
//     also has "branch" ("" for the checkout).
//   - show <id> --branches: the checkout's version of the issue, then each branch version of it, by branch;
//     not_found when there is none. It reads only that issue from each branch, so its warnings are about that issue.
//     --retracted applies to each version. Text: each version as show prints it, a branch version after a line
//     "=== branch <name> ===", with a blank line before every version but the first. Data: a list of show's data,
//     each with "branch" ("" for the checkout), a list even when there is one version.
//   - comment <id> --kind evidence|decision|result [--source s] "text": adds a comment with a new id, by, persona and
//     model from the actor flags, and at set to Env.Now as in new. The text must not be blank, and gets a trailing
//     "\n" as a body does. evidence needs a --source that is not blank; any other kind, github included, is a usage
//     error. A comment never changes issue.md. When the text's words.Overlap with a retracted comment on the same
//     issue reaches the config's retracted_match, the comment is still added, with one warning per such comment in
//     comment order: "matches retracted comment <comment id> (reason <reason as %q>)". Text: the new comment id and
//     "\n". Data: {"comment": the comment, "retracted_matches": [{"comment": id, "reason": reason, "score":
//     overlap}, …]}, retracted_matches an empty list when there are none.
//   - retract <id> <comment> --reason "…" [--disproved-by <comment>]: keeps the comment and sets retracted_by to the
//     actor, retracted_at to Env.Now as in new, retracted_reason, and disproved_by. The reason must not be blank.
//     --disproved-by names another comment on the same issue: one that does not exist is not_found, and the comment
//     itself is a usage error. A comment already retracted is an "error" and stays as it was. Text: "retracted
//     <comment>\n". Data: the comment.
//   - purge <id> <comment>: deletes the comment's file, retracted or not. Text: "purged <comment>\n". Data:
//     {"id": the issue id, "comment": the comment id}.
//   - tags: every tag on any issue, with the number of issues that have it (an issue counts once), sorted by tag in
//     byte order. Text: one "<tag>\t<count>\n" line per tag. Data: a list of {"tag", "count"} (an empty list, never
//     null).
//   - milestones: every milestone with a file in milestones/ and every milestone an issue names, with the number of
//     issues that name it. A milestone without a file has "" for title, status and due. Sorted by due, those without
//     one last, then by id. Text: one "<id>\t<due>\t<issues>\t<title>\n" line each. Data: a list of {"id", "title",
//     "status", "due", "issues"} (an empty list, never null).
//   - milestone new <id> "title" [--due YYYY-MM-DD]: writes milestones/<id>.md with the config's first status. The id
//     must not be empty, contain "/" or start with "." (a usage error). An id that already has a file is "exists",
//     and a file that does not parse is an "error"; either way the file is left as it was. The title must not be
//     blank. Text: the id and "\n". Data: the milestone.
//   - milestone edit <id> [--title t] [--status s] [--due YYYY-MM-DD]: changes only what is given, and at least one
//     change is required. The title must not be blank, the status must be one of the config's, and an empty --due
//     clears it. The file's other keys and its body are kept. A milestone without a file is not_found, and a file
//     that does not parse is an "error". Text: the id and "\n". Data: the milestone.
//   - milestone with no subcommand, or any other subcommand, is a usage error. The subcommand is the argument right
//     after milestone.
//   - search <words>... [--archived]: the positional arguments joined by spaces are the query, and its words are
//     words.Split of it; a query with no words is a usage error. Archived issues, as ls reads them, are left out
//     unless --archived is given; closed ones are searched. An issue's matches are the query words found among the
//     words of its title, its body, and the bodies and sources of its active comments; tags are not searched. Issues
//     with at least one match are listed by matches, most first, then in store order. Text: one
//     "<id>\t<matches>\t<title>\n" line each. Data: a list of issues without "body", each with "matches" added (an
//     empty list, never null, when nothing matches).
//   - board [--html <file>]: the issues in a column for each status, as internal/board lays them out: the config's
//     statuses in its order, empty ones too, then any other status an issue has, in byte order. A column holds its
//     issues with the last update first, and is collapsed when the config's closed or archived names its status.
//     It takes no positional argument and only reads: it needs no actor and commits nothing. Without --html, text is
//     board.Text: a header "<status> (<count>)" per column, with ", collapsed" after the count for a collapsed one,
//     and a tab, then the id, title, tags joined by ", " and last update, separated by tabs, for each issue of a
//     column that is not collapsed; blank lines separate columns. Data: {"columns": [{"status", "collapsed",
//     "count", "issues"}, …]}, where issues are rows as ls gives them and are [] for a collapsed column, whatever its
//     count. With --html, it writes the page board.HTML makes, every column's issues included, to the file, replacing
//     it through store.WriteFileAtomic with mode 0644: a relative name is relative to Env.Dir, the folder must
//     exist, and an empty name is a usage error. The page is one fixed template filled with data; it loads and runs
//     nothing. Its title names the tracker by the name of the folder that holds the .cairn, and it says when Env.Now
//     made it. Text: "wrote <the file>\n". Data: {"file": its path, made absolute as above, "issues": how many
//     issues the page holds}. Neither has "total".
//   - --limit N and --all, on ls and search, cap the rows they print. Without either, they print at most
//     defaultLimit (30) rows; with --limit, at most N, which must be a whole number of 1 or more as strconv.Atoi
//     reads it; with --all, every row. Any other N, and --limit with --all, is a usage error. The cut comes after the
//     filters and the sort: ls keeps its last N rows, which are the newest issues, store order being oldest first,
//     and with --branches the branch versions, which come last; search keeps its first N, the most matches. Text and
//     data hold the same rows. When rows are dropped, the command warns "<shown> of <total> shown; --limit N or --all
//     for more". With --json, the envelope of ls and search always has "total": the number of rows before the cut, 0
//     when there are none.
//   - version.
//   - help prints a line that says what --json prints, then commandUsage, one usage line per command, then
//     agentRules, the rules in docs/spec.md. Data: {"usage": commandUsage, "rules": agentRules}.
//
// A tag is non-empty with no space, ",", "[" or "]". When it has a ":", the part before the first ":" must be one of
// the config's tag_groups. A milestone, as an id or as what an issue names, has no "/" and does not start with ".";
// an issue's milestone can also be "", for none.
//
// A milestone in data is {"id", "title", "status", "due"}, every key always present ("" when due is not set).
//
// An issue in data is {"id", "title", "status", "tags", "milestone", "due", "by", "persona", "model", "created",
// "updated", "github", "body"}, every key always present: tags is a list (never null), times are strings in
// model.TimeLayout (RFC 3339 UTC with three fraction digits, in text output too), github is a number (0 when not
// synced), and empty text is "". Only show adds "comments".
//
// A comment in data is {"id", "kind", "by", "persona", "model", "at", "source", "body", "retracted"}, every key always
// present: retracted is null for an active comment, and otherwise {"by", "at", "reason", "disproved_by"}, with ""
// for no disproved_by.
